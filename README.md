# Program 3 - Recursion & Set ADT

# Introduction
This assignment will have 2 parts. In the first part, you will implement and test a function that processes the elements of an array using recursion. In the second part, you will implement a set class template using an array.

# Run the app

```bash
g++ driver.cpp -o driver
```
```bash
./driver
```
Please enter 12 to test the output
```bash
sh-3.2$ ./driver
Enter a non-negative integer: 12
Factorial of 12 is: 479001600
Array elements in reverse order: 5 4 3 2 1 
Fibonacci number at position 7 is: 13
Sum of array elements: 15
2 to the power of 3 is: 8
Original string: Recursion
Reversed string: noisruceR
sh-3.2$
